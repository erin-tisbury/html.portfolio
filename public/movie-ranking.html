<h1> Erin's All-time Favorite Movies</h1>
 <h2>A list of movies I could watch over and over!</h2>
 <hr/>

 <h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
 <p>This movie night classic is first on my list for good reason.<br /> 
This is the ideal movie for any occasion and has the best one-liners.<br />
I have this whole movie memorized so that should tell you how much I <br />
love it! I grew up on this movie and it is one of my comfort movies <br />
when I'm sick. Deep down we all love a good fairy tale where the <br />
handsome guy rescues the beautiful girl, the bad guy is punished (or at <br />
least humiliated), the funny guys have all the best lines and a kid learns a <br />
lesson in love and what is important in life.

<h3>Star Wars - The Original Trilogy</h3>
<p>I mean, come on, these are some of the most iconic movies of all <br />
time and always will be. I remember watching these on my collector<br /> 
VHS tapes thinking I would never watch a movie that compared. I also <br />
had a massive crush on Han Solo and my first ever handle was HansGrl00<br/> 
WAY BACK in the 90's! The love story, the epic battles, the Ewoks, <br />
characters and aliens will always be a good dose of nostalgia for me.
</p>

<h3>Twister</h3>
<p>I realize this movie wouldn't make it in most people's top 100 movies<br />
but I happen to love it! I've always been fascinated with the sky and <br />
storms so this crazy group of storm chasers and their wild ways always<br />
sounds like a good time to me.
</p>

<h3>Disaster/Apocalyptic Movies</h3>
<p>I will group this last set together because I have a weakness for <br />
movies like this. World War Z, San Andreas, Day After Tomorrow, <br />
Jurassic Park (haha!), and others like this. Something about them <br /> 
makes me realize life right now isn't so bad...maybe that's why I<br />
go back to them over and over!</p>
